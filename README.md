## What is OOP? 🤔

- 🏭 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that uses **objects** to model real-world entities.

- 🌟 OOP promotes the use of **classes** to define the structure and behavior of objects.

- 🧩 **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** are key principles of OOP.

## Key Concepts 🔑

- 🧬 **Classes**: Blueprint for creating objects.
- 🧳 **Objects**: Instances of classes, representing specific data.
- 📦 **Attributes**: Data or properties of an object.
- 🎛️ **Methods**: Functions that perform actions on objects.
- 🧬 **Inheritance**: Allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.
- 🤹‍♀️ **Polymorphism**: The ability to use different classes interchangeably.
- 🌐 **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods within a class to control access.

## Getting Started 🚀
